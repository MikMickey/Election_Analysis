# Election_Analysis
Module 3 Project

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to help Tom analyze and create a vote count report to certify the US congressional race using Python as the programming language.

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has the following task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election:

 1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
 2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
 3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
 4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
 5. Determine the winner of the election basedon popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.8.1 (tags/v3.8.1:1b293b6, Dec 18 2019, 23:11:46) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32

## Election Audit Summary
The project to create a script to produce report to certify the US congretioinal race was successful. The script was not strictly written for the congressional audit, therefore it can also be used for senatorial and local elections. Script can be modified to show data for districts and cities. Resources or data to include districts for senatorial and cities for local elections. For the script, instead of counties; districts and cities will be evaluated and results will be the same the one completed for congressional race.

Using Python programming language made the project easy to generate and validate the count report. This is comparison to using Excel. Python also helped to just not do one algorythm but can also be refactored to use for another type election race such as districts and cities which also one of the purpose of this project
